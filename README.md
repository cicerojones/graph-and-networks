## Intro
Chapter 3 (Lists) of *ANSI Common Lisp* provides code for working with
breadth-first-search in a network. Chapter 7 (Going Beyond Basic
Lists) of *Land of Lisp* shows code for creating visualizations in .png format of
arbitrary graphs. I am trying to tie these pieces of code together.

## Org-babel Included with the Lisp source code is an org-mode file.
This also incorporates all the same code (though using the org-babel
format) as a possible exploration of Literate Programming. Ultimately,
the documentation that comes in the form of comments in the Lisp code
should be converted into a more expository form, per Knuth (or what I
imagine Knuth to have meant).

Thus, reading through the code in emacs, and selectively evaluating
and playing with the functions are you go along is a possible model
for understanding how it all works. Simply reading source code is one
way, but for pedagogical purposes an alternative method seems to me
desirable.
